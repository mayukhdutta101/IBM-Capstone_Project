IBM Capstone Project: Data Analytics with Power BI

📌 Project Overview

This project is part of the IBM Data Analytics Capstone, analyzing technology trends, future preferences, and demographics using a dataset of 18,821 respondents. The study focuses on programming languages, databases, cloud platforms, and web frameworks while also exploring age distribution, geographic representation, and educational backgrounds. The project was initially designed for Google Looker Studio, but I have conducted the analysis using Power BI for deeper insights and enhanced visualizations.

🔍 Key Insights

Programming Languages: JavaScript, Python, and SQL are the most used, while Go and Rust are gaining popularity.

Databases: PostgreSQL remains the top choice, with increasing interest in Supabase.

Cloud Platforms: AWS leads, while DigitalOcean and Hetzner are emerging.

Web Frameworks: React and Node.js dominate, whereas jQuery is declining.

Demographics: Most respondents are aged 25-34, with the highest participation from the U.S., Germany, and India.

Education: The majority hold Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees.
